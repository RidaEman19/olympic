                    <p>From dancing in the US Open stands at the age of eight to lifting the trophy in Arthur Ashe Stadium 11 years later, Cori "Coco" Gauff's rise in the tennis world has been meteoric. In 2023, she fulfilled her destiny by winning her home Grand Slam event, showcasing the immense potential that had been evident since her teenage years.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        
                       Born Cori Dionne Gauff on March 13, 2004, in Delray Beach, Florida, USA, she hails from a family of accomplished collegiate athletes. Her father, Corey Gauff, played basketball for Georgia State University, while her mother, Candi Odom Gauff, was a track athlete for Florida State University.

Gauff's talent for tennis became apparent early on, and aged 10, she went to France to train under Patrick Mouratoglou, the long-time coach of tennis superstar Serena Williams.

The youngster gained widespread recognition in 2019 when she received a wildcard entry to Wimbledon. In a stunning debut, the then 15-year-old defeated her childhood idol, Venus Williams, in the first round of the competition. Gauff's became the youngest player to reach the fourth round of the grass-court Slam since Jennifer Capriati in 1991. She further solidified her reputation as a future star by reaching the third round of the US Open later that year.
