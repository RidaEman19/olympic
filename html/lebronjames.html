                        <h3>biography</h3>
                    <p>LeBron James is universally regarded as one of the greatest NBA and basketball players of all time. The debate on whether he is the best has raged on among basketball fans, with arguments that could sway in either direction.

Born in Akron, Ohio, LeBron Raymone James attended St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in his hometown. There, he led his team to multiple state championships and earned the title of National Player of the Year during his senior year.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        
                       Following his illustrious high school career, James was selected as the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Wearing the iconic 23 jersey made famous by Michael Jordan, he soon claimed the Rookie of the Year award after his first full season in the NBA and represented the USA at the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, winning a bronze medal.

The 6-foot-9 (2.06m) athlete rapidly established himself as one of the premier players in the NBA after his Olympic debut in Greece. During an impressive seven-season stint with the Cavaliers (averaging 78 games player per season), the forward amassed numerous individual accolades, including the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, although the coveted championship still eluded him.
