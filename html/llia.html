                    <p>Ilia Malinin is one of a kind in figure skating.

The young American, born to Olympic figure skaters Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, is the only skater male or female to have successfully landed the quadruple Axel, skating's most difficult jump, in competition. The self-proclaimed "quad god", a nickname he has also chosen for his social media handles, is also the only man to have attempted seven quadruple jumps in a routine.

Coached by his parents, who represented Uzbekistan at the Nagano 1998 and Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics, Malinin has taken the figure skating world by storm.

He began skating aged six and won various medals nationally and internationally at the age-group levels.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        His first international season at junior level came in 2019/20, where he competed at the World Junior Championships and finished 16th. What would have been his second season internationally was disrupted by the pandemic; he competed at Skate America as a senior in a modified event and landed the quadruple toeloop and quadruple Salchow.
