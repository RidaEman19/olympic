                        <h3>biography</h3>
                    <p>Stephen Curry's influence on the sport of basketball and the NBA is recognised as transformational. Over the years, his impact on the game and his role in popularising the three-point shot has fundamentally changed the way basketball is played.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        
                        Following in the footsteps of his father, Dell Curry, a former NBA player, young Stephen started playing basketball at a young age. However, during his teenage years, his relatively modest height (1.80m or 6 feet) failed to attract major college scholarship offers.

Consequently, Curry enrolled at the relatively small Davidson College in North Carolina, where he would soon become a national sensation. His sophomore year was particularly remarkable as, grown to his adult height (1.91m or 6-foot-3), he led his team to the Elite Eight in the 2008 College Basketball Tournament, showcasing an astounding talent for three-pointers, including a tournament-best 23 of them.

The shot from beyond the arc would eventually become Curry's trademark as he entered the NBA with the Golden State Warriors in the 2009 draft, selected seventh overall.
