                        <h3>biography</h3>
                    <p>Tadej Pogačar had a clear goal in mind when he took on the Tour de France in 2020 and 2021 - to win it all. On both occasions, the Slovenian cyclist secured victory in the overall classification and earned the polka dot jersey for the best climber and the white jersey for the best young rider. This established him as a force to be reckoned with on the grand cycling stage.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        
                        Born in September 1998, just outside Komenda, north of Ljubljana, Pogacar's drive for success started at a young age. He was initially passionate about football while attending elementary school, but his interest shifted when his older brother, Tilen, started training at the ROG Ljubljana cycling club.

Eager to follow in his brother's footsteps, the young Pogačar began cycling at nine years old. Despite the challenge of finding a suitable bike, he wholeheartedly embraced the sport after his first race in 2008.

Pogačar, affectionately nicknamed "Pogi star," became a member of UAE Team Emirates in 2019. He made his debut for the team at the Tour Down Under, finishing 13th overall. Later on, he won at the Volta ao Algarve and also secured a win at the Tour of California. This made him the youngest rider in history to win a UCI World Tour stage race.
