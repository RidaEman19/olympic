                        <h3>biography</h3>
                    <p>Standing tall at an impressive 7 feet 2 inches (2.22m), Victor Wembanyama is an imposing figure in the basketball, both in stature and significance. The French star has stormed the NBA like no one before him.

Born on January 4, 2004, in Paris, France, Wembanyama's basketball journey started early. His parents, both international athletes, provided a rich sporting heritage. His father, Félix Wembanyama, a 6ft5 athlete, represented Congo in track and field, while his mother, Elodie de Fautereau, a 6ft2 basketball player, was a former French national team member and is now a decorated youth coach.

Wembanyama's exceptional height and athleticism attracted the attention of coaches and scouts while he was still a teenager. He initially plied his trade in the French league, playing for Nanterre 92 (2019–2021), ASVEL (2021–2022), and Metropolitans 92 (2022–2023), before setting his sights on the prestigious American NBA.

His journey to NBA stardom began when his team, Metropolitans 92, played in preseason friendlies against the G League Ignite in Las Vegas. In those two games, the French sensation averaged an astounding 36.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 2 assists, 1 steal, and 4.5 blocks, igniting curiosity and excitement among American basketball enthusiasts. The NBA even began showing the Frenchman's league games on its platform to allow viewers to monitor his progress.
